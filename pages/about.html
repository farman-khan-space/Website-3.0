                From an early age, I've been fascinated by solving puzzles. That passion led me to the world of data analytics, where every dataset is a new puzzle waiting to be solved. My goal is to do more than just report numbers; I aim to uncover the "why" behind them and translate those findings into a compelling story that drives action.

                My analytical approach is built on a foundation of technical proficiency and business acumen. I believe the most powerful insights come from a deep understanding of the business context, combined with rigorous analytical techniques. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can work with stakeholders to define problems, explore data, and deliver solutions that create real value.

                When I'm not analyzing data, you can find me exploring the mountains of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, reading about machine learning, or trying to find the best cup of chai in Malakand.
