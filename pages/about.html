        <p>Hello! I'm Farman Khan, a passionate Data Analyst dedicated to uncovering the stories hidden within data. With a background in statistics and a love for problem-solving, I specialize in transforming complex datasets into clear, actionable insights that drive business decisions.</p>
        
        <p>My journey into data began during my studies in economics, where I became fascinated by the power of data to explain real-world phenomena. Since then, I've honed my skills in SQL, Python, and data visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI. I thrive on the challenge of cleaning messy data, performing in-depth analysis, and presenting my findings in a compelling and understandable way.</p>
        
        <p>When I'm not wrangling data, you can find me exploring hiking trails, experimenting with new recipes, or reading up on the latest trends in machine learning. I believe that continuous learning is key in the ever-evolving field of data, and I'm always looking for new challenges to tackle.</p>
