            Hey there! My name is Farman Khan, and I'm a passionate data professional with a knack for turning
            numbers into compelling narratives. My journey into data began with a curiosity for understanding
            "why" things happen, and it quickly evolved into a career dedicated to helping businesses make
            smarter, data-driven decisions.

            I specialize in a wide range of analytical techniques, from exploratory data analysis and
            statistical modeling to building interactive dashboards and creating beautiful visualizations. My
            toolkit includes Python, SQL, and various BI tools. When I'm not crunching numbers, you can find
            me learning about the latest machine learning trends or contributing to open-source projects.
